# NOTE: I have made it as far as 'External programs', which I have not yet setup.
# (I have already handled some of the encryption part [passwords, for instance, are now encrypted and sourced below])

# ALSO NOTE: There is an 'Update' section with 'New Tools' for getting email to work offline!
# This is valuable, but I am skipping the step for now.

# FINALLY: No idea where my mail is stored (perhaps it is not at the moment - see above about 'New Tools' and working offline).
# I do have a Mail/ dir ready to recieve my emails for offline storage.
