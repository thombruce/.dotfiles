# .dotfiles

These are my .dotfiles (configuration files from the home directory in my new Arch Linux environment).

Ah, that's right! I've just installed Arch Linux! What a rush!!

My aim is to gradually enhance this environment, sharing my non-private configuration here as I add to it.

## TODO

- [ ] Install Zsh (I prefer it; I like the configurability of Zsh)
- [ ] Install Vim (this file was edited in Vi - similar, but different enough to be confusing)
- [ ] Install Neovim (why Vi, Vim and Neovim? Vi because it was the default for visudo [note: I also had to install sudo], Vim because it's better than Vi and a solid fallback that exists in most distros, Neovim because it kicks ass!)

_I've also already installed git, but this is not yet connected to my GitHub profile or any remote repositories._
